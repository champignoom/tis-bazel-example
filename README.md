This is a simple demo of tis-analyzer running on a bazel-based project adapted from the caesar demo and an [official Bazel example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/main/cpp-tutorial/stage3).

Before having tis-analyzer on your machine, you can find in [`run-analysis.sh`](./run-analysis.sh) the steps and the expected results of the analysis.
